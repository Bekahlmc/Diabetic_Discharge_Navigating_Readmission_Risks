## Overview

VitalCare Health Syste is aiming to reduce early readmission rates among diabetic patients to improve overall patient outcomes. To achieve this goal, an analysis will be conducted on a comprehensive dataset about hospitalized diabetic patients and whether they were readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

Tracking and mitigating readmission rates within 30 days of discharge serves as a critical key performance indicator for hospitals for two main reasons:

1. Firstly, an early readmission, occurring within 30 days of discharge, signals potential gaps in care that weren't addressed prior to the patient's discharge. These gaps elevate the risk of poorer patient outcomes, underlining the importance of comprehensive care continuity.

2. Secondly, early readmissions within this timeframe can cause significant financial burdens on hospitals. In addition to this, hospitals often receive only partial reimbursement from insurance providers for early readmissions.

### **The Dataset**

The dataset includes a decade's worth of US hospital data spanning from 1999 to 2008, with over 100,000 entries, each representing a patient's hospitalization and associated details. The target is `'readmission'`. It has more than 50 features, including demographic information such as:
- age group
- gender
- race

Alongside medical specifics such as:
- diagnoses
- medications prescribed
- number of procedures during hospitalization
- other pertinent details regarding the patient's stay.

### **The Goal**

The goal of this project is to use the dataset to develop a model capable of accurately identifying patients who are at risk of being readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
